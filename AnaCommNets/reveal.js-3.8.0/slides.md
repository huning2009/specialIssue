### The Matthew effect in science
#### The reward and communication systems of science are considered

By Merton, R. K.

---

### Outline
- Reward system of science
  - "Once a Nobel laureate, always a Nobel laureate."
  - A stratified distribution of chances
  - Unbalanced prestige and disproportionate credit
- How the Matthew Effect affects the comm system of science
  - Visibility difference between the well-known and less-known
  - The focalizing function of eminent men
- Influences of the Matthew effect on the macrosocial level

---

### Mapping to network Science
- Reward system of science = Set / Change the network structure
  - The prestige of the awards can be converted to the prestige of the laureates
- Comm system of science = Information flow in the network
  - Higher prestige = Greater visibility = More widely cited = Stronger appeal

---

### Question 1
Taking the scientific field as a network, what are the network characteristics of the laureates? (Characteristics include degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, clique, ...)

---

### Pros & Cons of the Matthew Effect
- Pros
  - Collaboration with prominent scientists can be converted into an asset
  - Charismatic roles are necessary for building norms and values
  - The self-fulfilling prophecy
- Cons
  - The overconcentration tendency of academic resources
  - Junior researchers are likely to be overshadowed by illustrious co-authors
  - High quality works produced by less-known scientists may be obscured

---

### Question 2
Since the Matthew Effect in science causes some negative effects, are there any strategies to avoid those problems?

### Emergence of scaling in random networks

By Barabási, A. L., & Albert, R.

---

### Outline
- Disclose a common property of large networks
  - The vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution
- Driving force behind the distribution
  - The increasing number of nodes (growth of nodes)
  - New vertices are more likely to attach to the well-connected vertices (preferential attachment)
- Result
  - Large networks self-organize into a scale-free state

---

### Question 3
What's the meaning of **scale**, **scale-free**, **scale-invariant**, **self-organizing**? How to explain them with real-life examples?

---

### The connectivity rule: random vs. preferential
- A `rich-get-richer` phenomenon can be easily detected in real networks
- Merton's work provides evidence for this viewpoint
- Nodes prefer to link to the more connected nodes
  - In the real world, there are many nodes with few links but a significant minority of very highly connected nodes [See Barabási's examples](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/5/#growth)

---

### Question 4
What are the differences between the small-world network and the scale-free network? Whether the scale-free network challenges the rationality of small-world network?

---

### Scale-free network vs. Random network
||Scale-free network|Random network|
|:----|:----|:----|
|Representative|B-A Model|ER Model, WS Model|
|P(k)   |Power-law distribution  |Poission distribution   |
|Num. of vertices   |Fixed   |Continuous addition of new vertices   |
|Connection rule   |Radom and uniform   |Preferential connectivity  |
